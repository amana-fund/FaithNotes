### Adding New Themes

We encourage you to contribute new themes to HidayaDesk! To add a new theme, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a new CSS file** in the `src/assets/themes` directory. The filename should be the name of your theme in lowercase (e.g., `my-theme.css`).
2.  **Define your theme's styles** in the new CSS file. You can use the existing themes as a reference. At a minimum, you should define styles for the `.notebook-header` and `.add-page-btn` classes, as well as their hover states.
3.  **Import your new theme** in `src/App.vue`. Add a new import statement at the top of the `<script>` section, like this:
    ```javascript
    import './assets/themes/my-theme.css';
    ```
4.  **Add your theme to the `themes` array** in `src/App.vue`. This will make it available in the theme selector.

That's it! Your new theme will now be available in the application.
